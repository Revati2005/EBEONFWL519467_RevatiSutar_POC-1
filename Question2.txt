2. Concept of method implementation
Write a program to create ‘Square’ and ‘Rectangle’ class.
i. Implement methods to calculate area and perimeter of square and rectangles. 
These two methods are going to take side as argument in square and length and 
breadth in case of rectangle.
ii. Create a ‘MainClass’ in which define main method ,in which create two object for 
each Square and Rectangle class, Now calculate then show area and perimeter in 
the console after providing appropriate values for side , length & breadth using 
methods of these classes.

>>>Program :-


public class Area
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Rectangle obj = new Rectangle();
		obj.Area(10,20);
		obj.Perimeter(20,40);
		
		Square obj2 = new Square();
		obj2.Area(10);
		obj2.Perimeter(10);
	}
} 

class Square
{
	void Area(double side)
	{
		System.out.println("Area of the Square:"+side*side);
	}

	void Perimeter(double side)
	{
		System.out.println("Perimeter of the Square:"+(4*side));
	}
}

class Rectangle
{
	void Area(double l,double b)
	{
		System.out.println("Area of the Rectangle:"+l*b);
	}


	void Perimeter(double l,double b)
	{
		System.out.println("Perimeter of the Rectangle:"+2*(l+b));
	}
}


>>>Output :- Area of the Rectangle:200.0
	     Perimeter of the Rectangle:120.0
             Area of the Square:100.0
             Perimeter of the Square:40.0
