5. Find the output and write explanation?


class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	int t;
	System.out.println("Value of variable t : "+t);
	}
}


//Output :- error: variable t might not have been initialized
        System.out.println("Value of variable t : "+t);
                                                    ^
1 error

//Explination :- It will give Compilation Error because,In Java if a Variable Declared in main method without Initialization and print it then,
                 In java Globaly initialized variable then it will run.
