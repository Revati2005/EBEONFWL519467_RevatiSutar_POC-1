3. Initialize On Object Creation

i. Create a class Car which contains wheels and model as Instance variables.

>>>Program :- 


class Car1 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		
		int wheels = 4;
		String model = "Swift";

		System.out.println("Wheels:"+wheels);
		System.out.println("Model:"+model);
	}
}

>>>Output :- Wheels:4
             Model:Swift


ii. Initialize the number of wheels of the car at the time of creating the Object of the 
    car and assign the model of the car to the model variable and print the model after 
    creating the object of the car class(not at the time of creating the object).

>>>Program :-

class Car
{
	int wheels;
	String model;

	Car(int Wheels, String Model){
		wheels = Wheels;
		model = Model;
	}

	public void carinfo(){
		System.out.println("Model :"+model);
		System.out.println("Wheels :"+wheels);
	}

	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Car c = new Car(4, "Swift");
		c.carinfo();
	}
}


>>>Output :- Model :Swift
             Wheels :4
